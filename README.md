## Hi I'm Alfie üëã, an Apprentice Software Developer [@Hiyield](https://hiyield.co.uk) ‚ú≥Ô∏è

I'm currently investing my study into creating bespoke applications with Wordpress using a variety of technologies such as PHP and Petite Vue. Also, I have just finished developing a project 'LocalSeed' for my Year 2 Computer Science coursework at Truro College. LocalSeed is a micro-investment platform for small communities to depart as businesses and investors, financially exchanging to boost their local growth. You can find the repo here: [LocalSeed](https://github.com/alfiephillips/localseed)

Familiar technologies I use are 
- HTML: Jinja Templating;
- CSS: Styled-Components, Chakra-UI, Material-UI;
- Javascript/NodeJS: ExpressJS; React; NextJS
- Python: Django, Flask, Pandas, BeautifulSoup, Selenium;
- Visual Basic.
- PHP: Wordpress, Petite Vue

I am currently studying how to use VueJs with NuxtJS! I'm also familiarizing myself with TailwindCSS. This is what I'm using as a [Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/vue).

I'm also nearing 5 years of experience using backend technologies to construct various APIs such as [Oberen (GraphQL)](https://github.com/oberen-hq/oberen/tree/prod/oberen__api) and a [Booking System](https://github.com/alfiephillips/booking-system).
