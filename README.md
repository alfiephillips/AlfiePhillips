## Hi, I'm Alfie Phillips, An 18 year old Software Engineer from the United Kingdom.

I'm currently expressing my interest in Machine Learning and AI (Artificial Intelligence). I'm very keen to learn about how data is manipulated to create specific models and predict outcomes. One of my first projects using machine learning is [Dog or Cat](https://github.com/alfiephillips/dog-or-cat) Also, I am currently developing a project 'LocalSeed' for my Year 2 Computer Science coursework at Truro College. LocalSeed is a micro-investment platform for small communities to depart as businesses and investors, financially exchanging to boost their local growth. You can find the repo here: [LocalSeed](https://github.com/alfiephillips/localseed)

Familiar technologies I use are 
- HTML: Jinja Templating;
- CSS: Styled-Components, Chakra-UI, Material-UI;
- Javascript/NodeJS: ExpressJS; React; NextJS
- Python: Django, Flask, Pandas, BeautifulSoup, Selenium;
- Visual Basic.

I am currently studying how to use VueJs with NuxtJS! I'm also familiarizing myself with TailwindCSS and integrating NitroJS as a server engine. This is what I'm using as a [Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/vue).

I'm also nearing 5 years of experience using backend technologies to construct various APIs such as [Oberen (GraphQL)](https://github.com/oberen-hq/oberen/tree/prod/oberen__api) and a [Booking System](https://github.com/alfiephillips/booking-system).
