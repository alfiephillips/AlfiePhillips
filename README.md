## Hi I'm Alfie üëã, an Apprentice Software Developer [@Hiyield](https://hiyield.co.uk)

I'm currently investing my study into creating bespoke applications with Wordpress using a variety of technologies such as PHP and Petite Vue. Also, I have just finished developing a project 'LocalSeed' for my Year 2 Computer Science coursework at Truro College. LocalSeed is a micro-investment platform for small communities to depart as businesses and investors, financially exchanging to boost their local growth. You can find the repo here: [LocalSeed](https://github.com/alfiephillips/localseed)

Familiar technologies I am learning or use are:
- HTML: Jinja Templating;
- CSS: Styled-Components, Chakra-UI, Material-UI, Tailwind;
- Javascript/NodeJS: ExpressJS, React, NextJS, Nuxt, Vue;
- Python: Django, Flask, Pandas, BeautifulSoup, Selenium, Discord;
