## Hi, I'm Alfie Phillips, A 18 year old Software Engineer from the United Kingdom.

I'm currently expressing my interest in Machine Learning and AI (Artificial Intelligence). I'm very keen to learn about how data is manipulated to create specific models and predict outcomes. One of my first projects using machine learning is [Dog or Cat](https://github.com/alfiephillips/dog-or-cat)

I also have 3 years of experience using backend technologies such as Python, NodeJS and Visual Basic to construct various APIs such as [Oberen (GraphQL)](https://github.com/oberen-hq/oberen/tree/prod/oberen__api).
